			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Flowerhouse is a mobile solution that empowers users to make informed and confident decisions when
                purchasing flowers. It was created as a part of the Human-Centered Design class
                in MIT's Integrated Design & Management department. Our goal was to identify a problem space and user group 
                that we were unfamiliar with to explore pain points and unmet needs.
			</p>

			
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>
				From interviews, we discovered that customers often had trouble with phone, online, and in person floral orders.
			</p>

			<h3 class="question">How might we optimize the flower-buying experience for customers new to flowers?</h3>

			<h2>Unmet Needs</h2>
			<div class="unmet" style="text-align: center;">
				<div>
					<b>Confident</b>
					<p>
						Assured that the selection was the best option. </p>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>Seamless</b>
					<p>
						An easy and efficient process for ordering flowers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>
						Personalized
					</b>
					<p>
						Convey a personal message through the flowers.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2>Human-Centered Design Process</h2>
			<p>We followed the Human-Centered Design Process from MIT IDM for an MVP by the end of the course.</p>

			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<!-- <h3>Interviews</h3> -->
			<p>
				We interviewed 10 different users from different ethnic backgrounds and age groups. 
                Our youngest user was a 20-year undergad while our oldest was a 90 year old funeral home owner. Through observational and informal structured interviews, we gathered data on the user’s flower-buying habits and behaviors, motivations, and struggles.

            <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d9c9a_eabc5ae8d009407fa5dc299e7d1f7f32~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1622,h_686,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/user%20interviews.png" alt="User Interviews" width="100%">
            <h3>Interview summary</h3>
            <b>Florists</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Shops have been in business for many years, so many technologies are outdated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Busy dealing with many customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prioritize in person customers over online/phone orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    High tolerance for pain points: unlikely to implement new technology.
                </li>
            </ul>

			<img src="flowerimg/unorganized.png" width="100%">
			<br><br>
            <b>Customers</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Found pain points with ordering online, over the phone, and in person, especially for novices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of knowledge, consumes time and energy, unsure of arrangements, sees flowers as an investment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each customer has their own preferences and way of doing things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customers want certain meanings to be conveyed through the flowers.
                </li>
            </ul>

			<h3>Research Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    We organized the notes from our interviews onto a Miro board across 5 different categories: Positives, Negatives, Preferences, Cares, Florists.
                </p>

			<b>Key Quotes</b>
				<div class="left">
					"I wish the process was a bit more customized."
				</div>
				<div class="right">
					"Since I'm spending so much money, I wanted to be confident that my flower selection was the best option."
				</div>
				<div class="left">
					"I want to make it personalized. In Japan, flowers symbolize certain meanings, so I want that to be connected."
				</div>

				<br><br>
			<b>Insights</b>
            <p>
                These insights revealed that customers want customization, empowered decision-making, personalized options, and conveyed meanings in their flower purchases. Buying flowers isn’t simply a transactional process. Rather, there’s greater mental and emotional energy involved – and a lot of the pain points arise because of that. Understanding that was first and foremost to building empathy with the consumers in this unmet need. 
            </p>
            <b>We decided we wanted to help simplify the process and help customers make an informed pruchase.</b>
		
            <h2>User Personas</h2>

			<img src="flowerimg/userpersona2.png" alt="User Persona 2" width="100%">

			<h2>Initial Ideas</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Build a personal guide application for users.</li>
				<li>Provides information regarding flowers that are easy to digest.</li>
				<li>Pre-arranged flower options by occasions/purposes</li>
				<li>Gives users the opportunity to DIY flower arrangements at their own pace.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
			<img src="flowerimg/paperprototypes.png" alt="Paper Prototype" width="100%">

			<h2>User Testing Results</h2>
			<b>We had 10 users test out the paper prototypes.</b>
			<div class="left">
				"Why can't I buy the flowers directly from the app?"
			</div>
			<p>
				Users were confused about the purpose of the app. They were unsure if the app was a guide or a marketplace.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				"How do I navigate between screens?"
			</div>
			<p>Users were confused about how to return to the previous screen or move around the app.</p>

			<h2>Rethinking the Design</h2>
			<p>We needed to reevaluate how we approached our app. We originally did not want to allow 
				transactional purchases because we wanted to focus on the educational aspect of the app. 
				However, the users seemed quite frustrated that they couldn't purchase the flowers 
				they selected in the app. We decided to pivot our app to be a marketplace with educational
				components. We knew from our interviews with florists that older, more established shops 
				did not want to implement new technology. After interviewing 3 freelance florists, we decided to target newer, smaller shops that
				were open to expanding their customer base and increasing efficiency.

			<h2>Reflections</h2>
			<p>
				Originally, we wanted to pursue a solution targeted toward MIT students, but our mentors 
				encouraged us to go beyond the bubble and come up with a solution for an outside group with 
				which we had no prior experience or knowledge. I'm extremely grateful for this because it 
				forced me to step into the real world and dig deep into what the problem may be. I'm also 
				grateful for my teammates because we were able to effectively communicate and bring 
				different strengths to the table.
				<br><br>
				Before this experience, I would create a solution based on my own understanding of the problem. 
				Now I understand the importance of empathy and designing for the needs of other people.
