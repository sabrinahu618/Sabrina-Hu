			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Foodie was created as a way to connect friends together through a shared love of food. With so many places to eat, the options can be overwhelming. People ask each other for food recommendations all the time. Sure, you could go on Yelp or Google, but wouldn't you trust a friend's opinion more? They know the best places around! Foodie is a social media platform that allows you to rate and rank your favorite places and see where your friends have been.
			</p>

			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>This app aims to bring the MIT community together through a shared love of food. People with dietary restrictions can find places for them; people who enjoy eating the same types of cuisine can grab a meal together. It’s a social app that promotes sharing with localized food recommendations. MIT students can find places within their budget nearby that their classmates have been to before. Students can give their honest opinion, without the input of businesses.</p>

			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p>
				I came up with this idea because finding food places was a common theme that kept resurfacing. I have a friend who really likes to eat out. People ask her for her recommendations all the time, especially when they can't decide where to go or want to try somewhere new. There are also whole food Instagram accounts and people rate food on their stories. I notice freshmen asking upperclassmen for places to eat and furiously scribbling them down as the upperclassmen start listing out a bunch of places. When I went to New York, I asked three different people and each gave me 10+ places and a specific dish to try. This web application would be a really convenient way to consolidate all of this information and discover new places to eat.

			<p class="caption">
				I created this about page so users can understand what our mission was and how this website serves a purpose. I decorated it with doodles to illustrate the journey of using this product.
			</p>

			<h2>Feed</h2>
			<img class="center" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d9c9a_49adbb6b9dc042d586f4793f5285b572~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1196,h_598,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Feed%20foodie.png" width="800">

			<p class="caption">
				In each post, users can see the restaurant title, click on the map icon to see the restaurant in Google Maps, view the description, save and like the post, and also leave comments. If it's the user's own post, the card includes a delete button.
			</p>

			<h2>Upload</h2>

				Users go to the Upload page to create a post. They input the Restaurant name, their rating out of 5, upload the image, and customize a description or review.
			</p>

			<h2>Profile</h2>
			<img class="center" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d9c9a_5df51b17a50843fa89dd311b1e15fa44~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1196,h_604,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/4d9c9a_5df51b17a50843fa89dd311b1e15fa44~mv2.png" width="800">

			<p class="caption">
				When users click on Rank Your Posts, it brings up miniature cards of their posts so users can then drag and drop to save the order on their profile. Friends can then see how you've ranked the places you've tried.

			<h2>Friends</h2>
			<img class="center" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d9c9a_4e5c7aaeb4e44f55be76fc06fc2e5180~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1112,h_564,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/4d9c9a_4e5c7aaeb4e44f55be76fc06fc2e5180~mv2.png" width="800">
			<p class="caption">
				On the friends page, users can find their friends by inputting their email. If they've logged in before, then they are stored in the database and can be found. If you've sent a friend request, it will show in the Outgoing Friend Requests box. If you've received a friend request, it will show in the Incoming Friend Requests (which you can then accept or decline). On the right shows a list of all current friends with the option to remove.

			<h2>Messaging</h2>

			<p class="caption">
				On the chat page, your friends should automatically pop up on the sidebar. You can then direct message them and ask about one of their posts or go grab food together. There is also a Public Chat where everyone on the site can talk with each other.

			<h2>Reflections</h2>
			<p>
				This was the first time I created a website or used React, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. 
				It was definitely a challenging experience and we had very little time to build the whole thing. 
				My teammates and I met up every day to work on it and support each other. It was cool to watch 
				it grow from a simple state to a dynamic functioning product. In the process of building it, I asked my 
				friends to try it out and offer feedback. I wanted to test the usability of the website and make 
				sure the process was intuitive and satisfying to use. I'm excited to improve and learn more about 
				the principles and technologies for designing usable user interfaces through my Spring 2023 semester class: 
				Design for the Web: Languages and User Interfaces.
